### Time Complexity of List Operations

1. **Indexing**

   - **Access (Reading) an element**: \(O(1)\)
   - **Assigning a value to an element**: \(O(1)\)

2. **Appending**

   - **Appending an element at the end**: \(O(1)\) on average
     - Note: Amortized \(O(1)\) because when the list's capacity is exceeded, it may need to allocate more space and copy the elements, which takes \(O(n)\).

3. **Inserting**

   - **Inserting an element at a specific position**: \(O(n)\)
     - All elements after the insertion point need to be shifted.

4. **Deleting**

   - **Deleting an element at the end**: \(O(1)\)
   - **Deleting an element at the beginning or middle**: \(O(n)\)
     - All elements after the deletion point need to be shifted.

5. **Searching**

   - **Searching for an element by value**: \(O(n)\)
     - Linear search is required as lists are not inherently ordered.

6. **Slicing**

   - **Slice assignment**: \(O(k + n)\)
     - \(k\) is the length of the slice being assigned, and \(n\) is the number of elements being shifted.
   - **Slice retrieval**: \(O(k)\)
     - \(k\) is the length of the slice being retrieved.

7. **Length**

   - **Getting the length**: \(O(1)\)

8. **Concatenation**

   - **Concatenating two lists**: \(O(k + n)\)
     - \(k\) is the length of the first list, and \(n\) is the length of the second list.

9. **Reversing**

   - **Reversing a list**: \(O(n)\)

10. **Sorting**
    - **Sorting a list**: \(O(n \log n)\)
      - Python uses Timsort, which is a hybrid sorting algorithm derived from merge sort and insertion sort.

Here is a quick reference table:

| Operation         | Time Complexity      |
| ----------------- | -------------------- |
| Access (indexing) | \(O(1)\)             |
| Assign (indexing) | \(O(1)\)             |
| Append            | \(O(1)\) (amortized) |
| Insert            | \(O(n)\)             |
| Delete            | \(O(n)\)             |
| Search            | \(O(n)\)             |
| Slice assignment  | \(O(k + n)\)         |
| Slice retrieval   | \(O(k)\)             |
| Length            | \(O(1)\)             |
| Concatenation     | \(O(k + n)\)         |
| Reversing         | \(O(n)\)             |
| Sorting           | \(O(n \log n)\)      |

### Explanation of Notations

- \(O(1)\): Constant time – the operation takes the same amount of time regardless of the size of the list.
- \(O(n)\): Linear time – the operation time increases linearly with the size of the list.
- \(O(n \log n)\): Log-linear time – more efficient than quadratic time but less efficient than linear time for large lists.
